    <p>
     I like to read self-help books because these help me to figure out answers to my life, 
    for example, <em>what I want to be and what I really want to do.</em> 
    These days, however, I am interested in health and I work out three times at least a week at Algonquin Gym, 
    and I am managing my diet, so I like this saying <blockquote><q>You are what you eat.</q>-<cite>Anthelme Brillat-Savarin
    (19<sup>th</sup>, French)</cite></blockquote>
   
        <br>Therefore, I enjoy having vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes, carrots, avocados, apples, olives and so on  
    (<abbr title="also known as.">aka.</abbr> Mediterranean Diet). I can feel that these things are having a positive impact on my body. 
    For instance, <strong>My skin has brightened, my weight has decreased and my fitness level has improved.</strong>  
    My ultimate goal is to be 20 billion rich and writter later, so I should live a long healthy life.
